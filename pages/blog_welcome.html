            <p>The fullfilment of Moore's law by improvements in processor design has had an amazing run and the creation of a world-wide network has been culture-changing.  But IMO, nothing in computer technology has changed more dramatically over the past decades than the nature of code.  In the distant past, when most progams were compiled directly into machine code, a variable was a pointer to a memory address and a function could be readily located in a memory dump.  Today code is often run on layers of abstraction - Javascript in V8 in Chrome or Java in a JVM or Python in a runtime environment - all of which could be running in a Linux virtual machine in VirtualBox on OSX.  Language, freed from hardware, has become rich, complex, capable, and accessible.  Code holds the future.  I hope you can get as excited about code as I am and I hope these notes can help make someone's challenges a bit easier.</p>

            <h2>Elements in the creation of this site.</h2>
            <h3>Angular.js</h3>
            <p>This site is coded in Angular v1 and made pretty with Bootstrap v3.  The concept of the SPA - single page app - which Angular embodies raises the once maligned Javascript to new levels.  Combining the SPA with serverless hosting brings web site creation to a new level.  Developers and operations can now be unencumbered by platform issues and focus on delivering code.  Angular 2 is now available as a final release, but the many changes that were made on that journey made Angular v1 the practical choice as the framework.</p>
            <h3>3D programming</h3>
            <p> The Processing programming language from MIT Labs is a fascinating creative tool.  Unfortunately, Processing is a standalone program, although some solutions to port to browsers now exist.  WebGL is the very successful port of OpenGL to the browser.   But most who have tried it have found programming shaders in the GPU to be a tedious and mind-twisting task.  Enter THREE.js which is a brilliantly created Javascript library wrapping WebGL.  THREE.js code can be embedded in an Angular directive but there are challenges in the integration which seem to stem from the THREE.js render loop being launched outside of the Angular watcher loops. In the end, I chose to launch the 3D page in its own window to avoid leaving orphaned processes in the browser.</p>
            <h3>Hosting on Amazon Web Services</h3>
            <p>Amazon Web Services - AWS - has grown at an astonishing rate in the past few years.  All of the work of creating a physical servers and networks has been abstracted into an environment of EC2 instances and VPC - virtual private clouds.  The next step of abstraction beyond that is to serve static pages which perform frontend logic in the browser.  Backend compute can be done in a serverless manner using the AWS Lambda service.   This site is simply a S3 bucket that is being served as a static site.</p>
            <h3>Other</h3>
            <p>The 3D objects on this site were created in Blender and imported into THREE.js.  Logos and icons were created with Affinity on OSX.  Photography was done using a Nikon full frame DSLR and Nikkor lenses and enhanced with Adobe Lightroom.  Various data mangling tasks were perfomed in Python.  All of these constructions were created by the author.</p>
