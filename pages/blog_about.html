            <p>This site is a project of Danny Kobayashi.  A long time techie, starting with IBM and CDC mainframes.  In the 1970's, he worked in the data analysis of Air Force ICBM test shots.  In the 1980's he was a system administrator on IBM 3090 mainframes.  In the 1990's, he worked on an early implementation of an international VOIP network for a telecom startup.  In the 2000's and 2010's, he has worked in infrastructure and IT management.  He has been through the transitions from mainframe to Novell to UNIX to Windows to Linux to VMware to the cloud.  On the networking front he has worked with every iteration of ethernet from 10BASE5 thicknet on a Xerox network to 10 gigabit on Cisco Catalysts.  He wrote his first programs in Fortran and IBM 370 Assembler.  Largely self-taught, his early education in computer operating systems and mathematical analysis was gained by working with actual rocket scientists while he was in his 20's.</p>
            
            <p>Today he lives in Los Angeles, spending his time writing code in Javascript, Python and a little Swift.  Hardware obsessive, he loves spinning up and destroying vm's on OSX and Xeon-based Windows and Linux hosts interconnected by Cisco switches.  Having listened to electronic music starting with Tangerine Dream's <i>Riccochet</i> in the 1970's, he listens to EDM and ambient, some Miles and Bill Evans and some Mozart and Mahler.   And last but certainly not least, he loves spending time playing with twin grandchildren.  </p>
