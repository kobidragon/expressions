    <p class='lead text-muted'>In the 1940's, Claude Shannon equated the quantity of information in a stream of data to the degree of "surprise" that is accompanied by the arrival of each new symbol in the transmission.  The degree of randomness or "surprise", known as entropy, is what determines the ease with which a particular password can be cracked.</p>
    <p>Random in this case does not mean "something out of the blue", it refers to a state devoid of structure.  Words and number series have a high degree of structure.  It turns out that humans are not good at inventing unique passwords.  Hackers use databases containing millions of previously cracked passwords to perform what is known as a dictionary attack, making letmein, football, and trustno1 eminently crackable.  Hackers also rely on the human penchant for structure in other focused cracks - using all numbers, birthdates, keyboard patterns, character substitutions, all uppercase, all lowercase.  Combinator cracks can defeat the famous correcthorsebatterystaple because this string, which appears to have a high degree of entropy because of it's length, is the concatenation of 4 low entropy segments.</p>
    <p>We need to be able to remember passphrases with much less structure.  To aid in this, we will rely on mneumonics, a word derived from the Greek word for memory.  The use of techniques to aid in memorization and recall, the "art of memory" as it was known, has been a subject worthy of study by authors and philosopers throughout history including Plato, Simonides of Ceos, Saint Thomas Aquinas, Francis Bacon, Descartes, and Leibniz.</p>
    <p>This is how the mneumonic password generator works.  You start by entering a phrase that is memorable which the app parses with a simple regular expression to pick out the first character of each alphanumeric word.  Then the app checks the resultant string for 3 letter English words and common 3 letter combinations, splitting those up with insertions of randomized numbers and special characters.  The three letter combinations, called trigrams, were taken from a list ordered by frequency which was compiled by Peter Norvig using the Google trillion word corpus in 2008.  Finally, the app ensures at least 1 lowercase, uppercase, number and special character exists in the solution.</p>
    <p>Of course, if everyone used the first line of the Gettysburg Address as the seed, then variants of that would appear in black hat dictionaries and defeat you.  But there innumerable sentences from books, songs, movies, your grandmother's favorite sayings, and the Wikipedia description of  your basset hound from which to choose.  In selecting your seed sentences, obscurity will be preferred.  Also, to resist brute force attacks, the longer password is better - 8 characters would be a minimum, 12 or more is preferred.  The goal is to maximize the of entropy of the password - by creating a long string of characters, each of which has a high level of "surprise".</p>
    <p>The generated password is checked for strength level using the zxcvbn Javascript app provided by Dropbox.  It checks against a list of common passwords, names, English words, repeated characters, alphabet and number sequences and keyboard patterns.  The estimated time to crack is based on a parameter returned by zxcvbn called offline_slow_hashing_1e4_per_second which assumes an offline attack on a well encrypted database using moderate computational resources.   This and other estimates of password strength that are found on the Internet should be considered as a guideline and not a guarantee.  Your service provider may do a poor job of encrypting its password files, the hacker may have an impressive array of hardware resources, and the black hat community is routinely a step ahead in techniques.

<p>Claude Shannon, who reportedly made a small fortune in his spare time by gambling in Las Vegas, knew that understanding entropy can be your friend.  Now you do too - happy password making!</p>
