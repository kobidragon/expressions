<h2 class="blog-post-title">Future Features</h2>

    <p>Next on the agenda for this site is to add a restful backend written in node.js or scala and connecting to a noSQL database.  This will provide the basis of a repository for future how-to pages and possibly user login and authentication.</p>

    <p>When the feature set of the site is completed, more complex THREE.js apps with objects created in either Blender or clara.io would be fun.  Also images created in with the Processing language is a goal.</p>

    <p>Lastly,  a Python data analysis app or a chatbot would be interesting.  Since I am also delving into Swift, a companion IOS app would be totally groovy!</p>

    <p>Lots to do, so I will say "Good-bye and happy coding for now".</p>
